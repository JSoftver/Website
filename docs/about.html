            <h2>1. Join JSoftver</h2>
            <p>Short information: If you want to join the organization, you need to be able to program primarily in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Then you need to know English, and that’s a plus point if you can program in even more languages. Attention! If you get into the<span id="dots">...</span><span class="hidden" id="moreText"> organization, that doesn't mean you get access to private teams too! You will also need to apply for a separate permit to enter there. In turn, you get permission to join the public team. Remember: Public teams are there to work on a public project! You can even gain access to private teams when we assign everyone to a programming group and reach a certain level (amateur, beginner, advanced, programmer, professional, master, grandmaster, legendary, etc ...) and we need you in a project , then we get into the private team and with it the project. But remember: It also comes with a lot of responsibility! If you’re not sure you can do it or don’t want to take it on, feel free to tell, and then we fully understand.</span><span class="warning hidden" id="moreWText">One more important piece of information: This is not a job! People are not paid here! We only do this for hobbies and development!</span></p>
